`SimplifyXMLObject` is an open source lightweight xml parser, which has the advantages of forming a tree structure, intuitive and easy-to-understand usage process, and easy code writing.

**Note!** The current version of `SimplifyXMLObject` is only a beta version, and its reliability has not been extensively tested. For stability, please refer to or use major well-known xml parsers such as `DOM4j`.
